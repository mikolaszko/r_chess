# 🤔 What is this?

Chess in Rust, created from wanting to get better at idiomatic Rust and a deep need to do some Chess Programming.
Piece centric game design without an evaluator (for now). 

# Goals
  - backend with 0 dependencies
  - highly portable frontend with GUI lib.
  - custom FEN parser that allows .fen file read as board state
  - Fast

# 🛠️ Installation

Portability is very important to me and there will be a list of all the distros that have the build etc.

# ✨ Features
